# Kubernetes-manifestfiles
A Kubernetes manifest file is a text file written in YAML or JSON format that describes the desired state of a Kubernetes resource. These resources can include various components such as pods, services, deployments, config maps, secrets, and more. The manifest file specifies how these resources should be configured, deployed, and interact with each other within a Kubernetes cluster.

The importance of Kubernetes manifest files lies in several key aspects:
Declarative Configuration:

Manifest files allow users to declare the desired state of their applications and infrastructure in a declarative manner. Instead of specifying a sequence of steps to achieve a desired state, users define what they want, and Kubernetes takes care of the implementation details.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Kubernetes manifest files are a form of Infrastructure as Code, enabling version control, collaboration, and automation. They can be stored in version control systems (like Git), providing a history of changes and facilitating collaboration among team members.
