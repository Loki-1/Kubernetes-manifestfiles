Persistent Volumes (PVs):

Think of PVs as virtual disks that are available for use within the Kubernetes cluster.
Administrators set up PVs by defining the storage type (e.g., NFS, iSCSI), size, access modes, and other parameters in YAML files.
PVs represent the actual physical or cloud-based storage that is provisioned and managed by the cluster administrator.
They exist independently of any pods that use them.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):

PVCs are like requests made by applications (or developers) for storage resources.
Developers define PVCs in YAML files, specifying the storage requirements such as size, access mode, and storage class.
When a pod needs storage, it references a PVC rather than directly interacting with a PV.
Kubernetes dynamically binds PVCs to PVs that match the requested criteria.
If a suitable PV isn't available, Kubernetes can dynamically provision one based on the PVC specifications.
Binding of PVCs and PVs:

When a PVC is created, Kubernetes searches for a PV that satisfies the PVC's requirements.
If a suitable PV is found, the PVC is bound to that PV, and the pod can use the storage.
If no matching PV exists, and the storage class allows dynamic provisioning, Kubernetes automatically provisions a new PV that matches the PVC's requirements.
Usage in Pods:

Pods consume storage through PVCs.
Inside the pod's YAML definition, developers specify the PVC they want the pod to use.
Kubernetes ensures that the pod has access to the storage provided by the bound PV.
Storage Lifecycle Management:

Administrators manage the lifecycle of PVs, including provisioning, resizing, and deletion.
Developers manage PVCs, creating, deleting, and modifying them as needed for their applications.
